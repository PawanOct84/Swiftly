# Swiftly - Understand Your JSON Better


**What is Swiftly?**

**Swiftly is a Swift model generator that formats and generates codable models, UI models, and properties for the given JSON and also breaks them into files making it easy to manage and share between several models.**

**Features: **

- The models that are generated depend on Swiftâ€™s inbuilt Codeable feature making encoding and decoding objects a thing of the past.
- Allows opting for optional or non-optional variables by selecting each element.
- Allows an array of a certain object type with different properties to be merged into a single model with all properties.
- Pastes JSON from the clipboard to generate all possible models.
- Generates public struct UI model class to hold codable response data.
- Generates properties and dependency blocks for ViewModel.
